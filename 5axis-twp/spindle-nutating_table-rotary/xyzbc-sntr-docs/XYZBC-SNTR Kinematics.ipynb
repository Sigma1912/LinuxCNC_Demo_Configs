    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper describes how to derive the kinematic model for a 6-axis machine tool in an XYZABC configuration with Tool side B,C rotation of the spindle and work side A (table) rotation . In this example the C axis is a primary  and the B axis is the secondary rotary axis. The primary being independent of the secondary axis. The secondary axis being the one closest to the tool. The model presented here will be named 'XYZACB-TRSRN'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used here will be a step by step approach. Starting with a working kinematic model for a single rotary axis all the required elements will be added to build a complete kinematic model for the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model includes tool-length compensation, compensation for mechanical offsets between the two rotational axis B and C and compensation for setups where the machine reference point is not located on the rotation-axis of the A rotary table. The nutation angle is adjustable from 0 to 90° as measured from the vertical.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this document only basic mathematical functions are used so the kinematic models derived can be used directly in the 'userkins.comp' template file provided with the LinuxCNC installation. All calculations can be done whithout the use of any computer algebra systems, however the use of computer assistance like 'sage' will make the process of matrix multiplication much less error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are other and potentially more computationally efficient ways to build custom kinematics using built in libraries like 'posemath'. Posemath provides many functions for efficient matrix manipulation and also offers functions for the use of quaternions. However the use of such a library would require a more indepth understanding of the mathematical theory that is beyond the scope of this presentation. Furthermore importing a library like 'posemath' into the 'userkins.comp' template would require substantially more programming skills than using the method applied in this paper. "

This may seem wrong but we have to remember that after the primary rotation ($Rp$) we have not yet built any offset (tool-length or pivot-length) into our model (ie there is no translation matrix on the right side of $Rp$). Hence for now a rotation around the spindle primary joint simply means that a tool of length zero (ie a point) rotates around itself and does not change it's position. So in the current form it is really not very interesting to test the effect of the added rotation so we will move on along the kinematic chain and add the geometric offsets ($D_x,D_y$) , the rotation of the secondary sindle joint ($Rs$) and the pivot-lengths of the spindle head ($Ly,Lz$) to arrive at the spindle nose."

    "The machine in our example has a 'nutating' secondary rotary joint. Nutating meaning here that the rotational axis is not parallel to any of the axes (x, y or z) of our machine coordinate system and hence we cannot use any of the basic rotation matrices to model it in our kinematic. The basic rotation matrices are only three particular solutions of a general formula to describe rotations around any given vector $V(v_x, v_y, v_z$) in space.\n",
    "In our particular case we will see that a regular (ie orthogonal) rotary assembly corresponds to a nutation angle of 90° and our kinematic model will also cover this particular machine type.<br>\n",
    "To construct the rotation matrix $R_s$ for the slanted sencondary joint of our spindle we will use the ‘Rodrigues' form of the general rotation formula. (Note that there is also an 'Euler-Rodrigues' formula that can be used for the same purpose but uses different parameters.)"

    "# Tool Kinematic model\n",
    "Many, if not most, applications for 5-axis milling do not require TCP kinematics where all five axes are moving simultaneously but only need the work piece to be oriented at certain angles to the tool in between 'conventional' three axis (x,y,z) milling operations. In these operations the tool is not reoriented while cutting the material. This is what is called '3+2' mode.<br>\n",
    "In 3+2 mode the machine operator can use the familiar built in cycles the machine controller offers for 3d (x,y,z) use and does not necessarily require CAM/CAD software to machine a part. The ability to move the tool in a plane perpendicular to its rotational axis also allows the use of probes for job setup.<br>\n",
    "Machines with work side rotation (eg the A rotary in our example, or the 'table-rotary-tilting' examples included in LinuxCNC simulation configs) can orient the work piece to the tool by simply rotating the work to the required orientation as the tool always remains oriented along the machine z-axis. A drilling operation on such a machine will thus still only require the machine z-axis to be moved no matter how the part is oriented.  In this case no special kinematic is required.<br>\n",
    "Machines with tool side rotation like the one presented here with B and C spindle rotations however retain the directions of the unrotated machine coordinate system when moving in IDENTITY and TCP kinematics while the tool orientation changes in respect to the machine coordinate system.  A drilling operation on such a machine will require the machine to move in a complex manner that may include all three (x,y,z) axes depending on how tool is oriented.<br>\n",
    "Commercial 5-axis machine controllers offer built in functionality that allow the operator to define work plane orientation using Gcode commands like G68.2 or similar; automatically adjusting the kinematic model to the type of kinematic of the machine. To implement such a feature for our example machine using LinuxCNC we need to create another kind of kinematic model which we will call the TOOL kinematic.  \n",

    "$R_{tc}$ is a virtual rotation around the rotational axis of the tool. This is required because we need a way to define the orientation of the tool-x (and -y). Without this the tool-coordinate system would be 'fixed' to the spindle head orientation which we do certainly want for the tool-z orientation but not for the x,y-directions. This will be important when developing the 'Tilted Work Plane' features later.\n",

    "This should give a rough overview of how TWP functionality is to be achieved with a python remap:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of TWP is to give the machine operator a mechanism to define a virtual work plane that is rotated (and optionally offset) in respect to the current machine coordinate system. As mentioned above this is fairly trivial in a machine with work side rotation as its tool spindle is fixed to be aligned with the machine z-axis. In such a machine the tool coordinate system (TCS) remains in the orientation of the machine coordinate system (MCS)<br>\n",
    "In a machine with tool side rotation however the TCS rotates in respect to the MCS as the rotary joints move. The orientation of the TCS for a given joint rotation can be calculated using the rotation matrix embedded in the transformation matrix as derived above. Furthermore we can also solve for the inverse case of finding the joint positions that will orient the tool to a given orientation.\n",
    "Note here that this is very much dependent on the specific kinematic of the machine at hand and will require careful analysis of the kinematic model to find any ambiguities in the solution as some specific tool orientations might be achieved in multiple joint positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to define the TWP means to define a target TCS in respect to the MCS and for this the use of a transformation matrix is well suited as it contains the rotation as well as the (optional) translation. \n",

    "### Step 1: Definition of the TWP\n",
    "The TWP is defined by a rotation (I,J,K) and optional offset (X,Y,Z) of the TCS in respect to the MCS. The optional offset is calulated from the current work offset position at the time when the G68.2 or G68.3 command is issued. \n",
    "\n",
    "The operator can choose from different methods to define the rotation of the custom work plane:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  G68.2 ... P0 ... - 'True Euler'-angles (this is the default if the P word is omitted)\n",
    "\n",
    "*  G68.2 ...  P1 ... - 'Pitch-Roll-Yaw'-angles\n",
    "\n",
    "*  G68.2 ...  P2 ... - 3 points in the plane (3 points define two vectors)\n",
    "\n",
    "*  G68.2 ...  P3 ... - 2 vectors (tool-x and tool-z)\n",
    "\n",
    "*  G68.2 ...  P4 ... - projected angles (A around machine-x, B around machine-y)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the above methods we create the transformation matrix either by using euler-rotations of the 4x4 identity matrix or by the vector information passed by the command, using the cross product to calculate the y-vector. For the projected angles we use basic trigonometry to calculate the vector components.\n",
    "These calculations are independent from the specific machine kinematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  G68.3 ...... - define TWP perpendicular to the current tool orientation \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we need to use the specific machine kinematic model to calculate the transformation matrix of the current TCS. \n",
    "\n",
    "*  G68.4 ...... - same as G68.2 but relative to the current TWP\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we need to multiply the current TWP transformation matrix with the one built from the command words.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  G69 - cancel TWP\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we reset the TWP transformation matrix to the 4x4 identity matrix (ie no rotation, no translation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, contrary to some other controllers, moves commanded between G68.x and G53.x will be in the MCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Orientation of the tool to the TWP\n",
    "Once the TWP has been defined the machine spindle can be oriented by moving the rotary joints to the appropriate positions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The operator can choose whether the rotation is done in IDENTITY kinematics (only the rotary joints move) or in TCP kinematics where all joints may move to keep the tool center point in position:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  G53.1 - orient the tool to the TWP without using TCP\n",
    "\n",
    "*  G53.6 - orient the tool to the TWP with using TCP\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling work offsets when switching to TWP\n",
    "The TWP is defined relative to the work offset (eg G54) active when issuing a G62.x command. With the execution of the following G53.x command and the reorientation of the spindle the kinematic is switched to the TOOL kinematics and the coordinate position in the DRO will then reflect the coordinate position in the rotated TCS. If the work offset values were to be used without adjusting for the kinematic switch then the physical position of the work offset would be rotated out of place and the reference to the work coordinate system (WCS) would be lost. So in order to find the reference on the work piece in the TCS we need to use the TWP transformation matrix to transform the work offset values set in WCS to the new TCS.<br>\n",
    "Note that the original work offset will have to be restored when the TWP is canceled with a G69 command.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling the optional TWP offsets when switching to TWP\n",
    "Since the optional offset of the origin of the TWP are to be applied before rotating the TWP we will need to either add these offsets to the current WCS before transforming the WCS or transform the WCS and the TWP offsets separatly and add them after."
