This is a simulation configuration for a 6 axis machine with the following kinematic:

XYZ - linear cartesian
  B - table rotary
  C - spindle rotary
  A - spindle nutating

The spindle rotary assembly is fully configurable using sliders in the side panel of the gui

The kinematic component includes the following modes:

IDENTITY: Trivial kinematics with a one-to-one mapping of joints to axes 
     TCP: Coordinated xyz motion with rotation around the tool center point
    TOOL: Coordinated xyz motion in the current tool coordinate system

This simulation also includes an experimental implementation of Gcodes for tilted workplane (TWP) functionality

Full Documentation is included in html format. 


IMPORTANT PREREQUISITS:

Install the required kinematic component:
halcompile --install <your-path-here>/xyzbca_trsrn.comp


Place the file 'twp_vismach.py' into the folder 'lib\python'
